# Introduction
The purpose of the **Remote Work Insights - Executive Dashboard** is to provide the ability to aggregate information across VPN, authentication, and video conferencing services to provide insights into the connectivity, productivity, and engagement across a remote workforce. An example dashboard that synthesizes information across these services is illustrated below:

![remote work app dashboard](media/remoteWorkExecDashboard.png)

**Dashboard Reference**: [RWI - Executive Dashboard (rw_exec.xml)](default/data/ui/views/rw_exec.xml)

The first row provides real-time information on the number of workers connected via VPN, real-time number of active Zoom video conferencing meetings, and the top application accessed via Okta for the current day. The second row looks at aggregate daily statistics over time for these same mission-critical indicators: number of VPN logins, number of Zoom meetings and average duration, and top 10 apps accessed via Okta. The bottom of the panel shows VPN connectivity counts by geographic location.

This document provides step by step instructions to install and configure your own **Remote Work Insights - Executive Dashboard**. It will allow you to dynamically create dashboards similar to the image above for a specific set of service providers: Palo Alto Networkâ€™s GlobalProtect VPN information, Okta authentication services, and Zoom video conferencing services. The instructions begin by highlighting a visual depiction of the data sources by service, a checklist of necessary Splunk Add-ons (commonly known as TAs) that must be installed, a runbook to ensure the proper Splunk Add-ons are correctly in place and finally a summary of steps required to start sending Zoom data to Splunk. 

## Example of Remote Work Insights Data Collection

**Note:**
* The JWT Webhook Add-On uses the default Splunk Web self-signed certificate and private key as described here: [About securing Splunk Enterprise with SSL](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/AboutsecuringyourSplunkconfigurationwithSSL). For security reasons and best practices, it is recommended to use a Trusted CA Signed SSL Certificates.

# Remote Work Insights - Executive Dashboard
## Remote Work Insights Executive Home Dashboard
![](media/remoteWorkExecDashboard.png)

**Dashboard Reference**: [rw_exec.xml](default/data/ui/views/rw_exec.xml)

The first row of the **Remote Work Insights - Executive Dashboard** provides real-time information on the number of workers connected via VPN, real-time number of active Zoom meetings, and the top application accessed via Okta for the current day. The second row enables us to look at aggregate daily statistics over time for these same mission-critical indicators: number of VPN logins, number of Zoom meetings and average duration, and top 10 apps accessed via Okta. The bottom of the panel shows VPN connectivity counts by geographic location. Sudden drops during working hours may indicate connectivity issues.

The combination of VPN, authentication, and video conferencing services will provide insight into the following questions for a remote workforce:
* Is our remote workforce connected?
* Are they able to stay productive and run the business? 
* Are they engaging with each other? 

## VPN Ops Dashboard
![](media/vpn_ops_dashboard.png)

**Dashboard Reference**: [rw_vpn_ops.xml](default/data/ui/views/rw_vpn_ops.xml)

The top panel of the VPN Ops Dashboard shows successful and failed login attempts by location. The middle sequence of pie charts provides more specific information by country and city, as well as an overall indicator of successful and failed login attempts. The bottom row provides a time history of login attempts and insight into the number of unique users logging in to the network, and also a more granular view of users by regions.

## Zoom Ops Dashboard
![](media/zoom_ops_dashboard.png)

**Dashboard Reference**: [rw_vc_zoom_ops.xml](default/data/ui/views/rw_vc_zoom_ops.xml)

The top row of the Zoom Ops dashboard displays real time Zoom statistics: number of current active video conferencing sessions, number of active participants, duration of the longest ongoing meeting, average meeting length, and shortest meeting in the last 1 hour. The middle row shows the number of meetings over time by hour and whether meetings are completed in the scheduled amount of time or run over to provide insight into the distribution of activity over the course of a day. The bottom row shows the number of meetings by type and also indicates the distribution of devices that were used to join Zoom.

## Authentication Ops Dashboard
![](media/auth_ops_dashboard.png)

**Dashboard Reference**: [rw_auth_ops.xml](default/data/ui/views/rw_auth_ops.xml)

The top row of the Authentication Ops dashboard provides real time authentication information for applications accessed via Okta: the success rate and the number of authentication attempts over the last hour. The middle row provides these same metrics over the past seven days, and indicates the reasons for failure. The bottom panel indicates the authentication success rate by application.
